# CHIP-8 emulator

With this projects I'm trying to hit two birds with one stone:

- Try out golang
- Try writing an emulator

This project's a bit messy right now and only semi-functional. It uses SDL2 for graphics, input and, in the future, sound.

### To do:

- [x] Implement all instructions needed for basic functionality
- [x] Add in graphics support
- [x] Add in keyboard input support
- [ ] Iron out kinks and quirks
- [ ] Refactor into a better structured project
